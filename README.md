# React Quick Start Guide - Starter Kit

This is the boilerplate code for following along with [The React Quick Start Guide](http://www.jackcallister.com/2015/01/05/the-react-quick-start-guide.html). It contains an index.html with React JS and the JSX transpiler. It's not intended for production purposes, just for quickly getting setup in order to learn React JS. It also contains a small amount of CSS.

All code from the guide should go in the script.js file found in the root of this repo.
